Programming started for me as a vocation in the early days of Nokia phones, trying to write Java :coffee: programs and games for
Symbian OS on my Nokia N73. While high school me could never figure out how to get it working, I did develop a lifelong love
for all things software.

After graduating with a BSc in Computer Engineering, I have been professionally developing production web services for
{% include years_of_experience.html %}+ years delivering cloud and on-prem services both from scratch as well as iterating over
production services.

I have a passion for developing SaaS services that are efficient, scalable, maintainable, secure, ... (okay you get it).
I am a firm advocate for coding standards and local setup. I am always looking for ways to automate and standardize coding practices in a way
that increases our team's momentum.
