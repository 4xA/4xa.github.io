Programming started for me as a vocation in the early days of Nokia phones, when I tried to write Java :coffee: programs
and games for Symbian OS on my Nokia N73. While my high-school self could never figure out how to create my JAR and install it,
I did develop a lifelong love for all things software.

Since earning my Computer Engineering degree, I have been professionally developing production-level applications for
{% include years_of_experience.html %}+ years in both greenfield and brownfield projects. I set a high standard for myself,
developing applications with architectures that are driven by their domain, while meeting desired quality-of-service
requirements of maintainability, extensibility, testability, and all other ‑ilities.

I am a firm advocate for domain-driven design, a seamless deployment path to production, healthy code reviews, automation,
and efficient local/cloud development.
